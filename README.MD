# GetBlok Plasma
GetBlok Plasma is a library on top of Ergo Appkit that provides an abstraction layer to simplify
the process of integrating AVL Trees (AKA *Plasma*) into off-chain code. The goal is to give developers an easy way 
to integrate this Layer-2 scaling solution into their ErgoScript contracts. GetBlok Plasma
also provides a simple, generalized versioned storage implementation that allows for integration with any database.
